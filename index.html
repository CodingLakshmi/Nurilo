			Nurilo is the new link between producer and consumer. As a network of community-based farms, Nurilo aims to increase agricultural employment, particularly in under-resourced areas. Nurilo elevates the symbiosis of farms and their communities, boosting economic prosperity.

      </br>

      </br>
      
      Through bridging the divide between producer and consumer creates, thus, a new circular system in which COVID affected jobs are in fact, restablished and a new long-term solution is created in which the forefront of our economy is once again situated in the driver of our daily lives - agriculture.

			With the spur of COVID-19, one of the most overlooked integral parts of our economy that has been impacted is farming. This
			unconventional problem has arisen as a consequence of the immigration laws imposed due to COVID-19: traditionally, workers
			from international parties work in the agricultural sectors - but as this has been restricted, farmers have been left
			with a diminished workforce.

    </br>
    <p id = "pTag1"> 
      Farming practices rely on the labour that stems from, in the majority of cases, international visitors and tourists. However, 
      on the other hand - millions of people have lost their jobs due to COVID-19 and as such, Nurilo bridges the gap between
			work and employees, creating a mutually beneficial relationship for both parties involved.
