			Nurilo is the novel way of connecting workplace and employees - with the interactive features it possesses, finding work
			on a farm is made easy. Farms simply advertise their farms and prospective employees (you!) are able to apply for a job
			based on the farm's location, jobs and produce sector.
      </br>
      </br>
      The infographic on the left depicts the stages in the Nurilo application process. Prospective candidates are encouraged to first view the location of the current farms involved in this project, and secondly cross check their CV to the requriments listed. 
      </br>
      </br> 
      After completing these step, the applicant should apply using the interactive survery - the farms the individual has applied to will receive their application and will endeavour to respond within 1-5 business days. 
      </br>
      </br>
      After this period, the applicant will receive status on their application and information regarding their working hours, wages and typical tasks working on the property. Applicants are reminded that each farm possesses different requiremtns and entails differing jobs; as such, each prospective farm should meeting one's abilities.
