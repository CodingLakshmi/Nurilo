		<h1> Megacities, COVID-19 and Agriculture </h1>
		<p id="pTag">
			According to a 2018 United Nations report, urban residency is projected to reach approximately 2.5 billion people. The rise
			of megacities, or regions with more than 10 million residents, in developing countries accounts for much of this rapid
			population growth; community resources and services are under stress, resulting in higher unemployment and poverty rates.
			In order to sustain the growing population, immediate action must be taken to maintain food security and economic development.
		</p>
		</br>
		<p id="pTag">
			The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing faults in the U.S. agricultural system; not only are consumers impacted by
			empty store shelves and rising prices, but farmers themselves will face severe economic crises in years to come. With
			the shutdown of restaurants and stores across the nation, shelter-in-place orders have created a drastic decline of food
			demand; the surplus of agricultural outputs is a detriment to the U.S. economy.
		</p>
		</br>
		<p id="pTag">
			Farming practices rely on the labour that stems from, in the majority of cases, international visitors and tourists. However,
			on the other hand - millions of people have lost their jobs due to COVID-19 and as such, Nurilo bridges the gap between
			work and employees, creating a mutually beneficial relationship for both parties involved.

		<h1> Impacts of Megacities on Farming & Jobs: </h1>

    </br>
    <ul>
      <li> Increase in population causes urban sprawl - the movement of the city outwards into the country. This causes the amount of farm land to diminish. </li>
      <li> Furthermore, this means that the populace will  be less likely to work in these agricultural sectors due to the increasing breakdown in relations between city and country. </li>
      <li> As such, the vast number of jobs being allocated to farming pracitices are being worked on by seasonal workers - with the spur of COVID, farms have been left destitute with far the enough workers. </li>
      <li> Furthermore, millions of civilians have also been left without a stable job and occupancy. </li> 
    </ul>
  	<p>
		  Urban farming is a food system, comprising of locally-grown plants and livestock in urban areas. Low-income communities benefit from affordable and accessible produce, as well as long-term employment.
	  </p>
    <p>
      Groups at risk of unemployment, such as single mothers and formerly incarcerated individuals, may apply as produce pickers on Nurilo farms. Additionally minors seeking job experience are encouraged to apply. Supporting disadvantaged social groups benefits the greater community; when united in symbiosis, all community members thrive.
